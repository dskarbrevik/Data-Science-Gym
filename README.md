# Welcome to the Data Science Gym!

This is a training ground for anyone that wants to sharpen their Data Science skills by simply practicing Data Science.

<br>

## The Big Idea

Give yourself a three hour block to work on a data science-y workout/challenge and see how far you can get and how much you can learn.

These are essentially timed mini-projects or maybe data science style mini-hackathons...

At a high level there are three types of "workouts" a.k.a. challenges... but I like this gym theme so please humor me :D

1) **Data Collection Workout** (e.g. "Get data about topic X and make 1 interesting finding about the data you gather.")

2) **Data Analysis Workout**  (e.g. "Given pre-cleaned dataset X, form 2-3 actionable insights.")

3) **Machine Learning Workout** (e.g. "Given pre-cleaned dataset X, build 1-2 models to answer question X.")

## How to Get Started

Checkout the <a href="">Iris Into Workout</a> notebook to see the format of a workout.

Notebooks are labeled with a [TYPE #] scheme (i.e. [ML 1] = the first machine learning workout), so

## FAQ that Nobody Asked For!

### Do you document the progression of this project in any way?

Yup! Check out my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WqhBQbJTI7LIToUCpqMwFc7u57_tPpteHiPLAAiuALo/edit?usp=sharing">project updates blog</a>.

### Why did you make this project?

(... only read this if you're very bored)

I recently graduated from a Data Science Master's program, and while thinking about how I could continue my education independently I came up with this project as an answer.

Even though I am probably the only person that will ever use this repo, I decided to format this project in a general way because (other than Kaggle) I don't think there are enough "learn by doing" resources for Data Science. Before studying Data Science, I studied neuroscience as an undergraduate. In my na√Øve days of education (end of high school and early undergrad) I would look at a great textbook like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Neural-Science-Fifth-Kandel-ebook/dp/B009LHFYNG">Kandell's Principles of Neural Science</a> and think, "OK David, you just need to cram the contents of this book into your head and you'll be awesome!". But that book is bigger than my head, so there were logistical issues. And more seriously I just can't sit down and read a 1,000+ page textbook from cover to cover with full, thorough understanding. However, if there were a way to actually *practice* neuroscience, you would have had me sold. The closest (not that close) version of this is working in a research laboratory, which I did for many years. Now, when I look back on it, I think about how insane it is that the balance of reading a textbook vs. working in a lab is for biology/neuroscience undergrads. Anyway, to avoid getting too passionately off-topic, I mention my experience with neuroscience to say that the ability for anyone with a computer to just start *doing* data science is largely what attracted me to the field. "Tiny puzzles and self discovery" is my philosophy for learning, so this repository is really a tiny monument to that idea.
