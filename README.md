# Welcome to the Data Science Gym!

This is a training ground for anyone that wants to sharpen their Data Science skills by simply practicing Data Science.

I (repo owner) recently graduated from a Data Science Master's program, and while thinking about how I could continue my education independently I came up with this idea.

Even though I am probably the only person that will ever use this repo, I am going to format it in a general way so that anyone can try my challenges for themselves!

<br>

## The Big Idea

Three times a week, give yourself a three hour block to work on a data science-y workout/challenge and see how far you can get and how much you can learn.

<br>

## Types of Workouts

At a high level there are three types of "workouts" (a.k.a. challenges... but I like this gym theme so please humor me :D ):

1) **Data Collection Workout** (e.g. "Get data about topic X and make 1 interesting finding about the data you gather.")

2) **Data Analysis Workout**  (e.g. "Given pre-cleaned dataset X, form 2-3 actionable insights.")

3) **Machine Learning Workout** (e.g. "Given pre-cleaned dataset X, build 1-2 models to answer question X.")
